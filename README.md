# ChronoShift
Game revolving around the mechanic of chrono shifting, which allows the player to produce clones that repeat the actions of the player. To do this, the player holds down a key (Spacebar by default) and until the player releases the key, everything the player does is recorded. When the player releases the key, a clone from the past is spawned that repeats the actions until released.

# Objective
The objective is for the player to collect all the required pieces in a level to open the door to the next utilizing this mechanic to overcome challenges.

# Level Editing
To make creation of levels faster (this was a school project), I implemented a system that scans an image file and builds the level out of its pixel-data, so creation of levels can be done quickly with a simple image editing program like Paint .NET
